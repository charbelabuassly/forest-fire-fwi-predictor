    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "- **Skewness present** in FWI distribution → Log transformation recommended\n",
    "- **High multicollinearity** detected (BUI & DMC: 0.98, BUI & DC: 0.94)\n",
    "- **Strong predictors identified:** ISI (r=0.89), FFMC (r=0.87), DMC (r=0.81)\n",
    "- **Weak predictors:** Wind Speed (r=0.02)\n",
    "- **Seasonality observed:** Peak fire activity in August-September\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Deductions:**\n",
    "- Regularization techniques (Ridge) recommended due to multicollinearity\n",
    "- Log transformation applied to target variable (FWI)\n",
    "- Feature selection needed to eliminate redundant variables (Lasso)\n",
